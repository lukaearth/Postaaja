# Postaaja

**Postaaja** was an early full-stack SaaS project I built in **2025** as one of my first serious development projects.  
It was a real business attempt focused on selling **personalized, fine-tuned AI chatbots** for sales professionals, integrated directly into **Telegram**.

The core idea was to help users generate high-quality sales listings in their own writing style in seconds, instead of spending hours manually writing posts.

While the business itself did not scale, the project represents a significant step in my journey as a developer and demonstrates practical experience across frontend, backend, APIs, and AI integration.

## What Postaaja Did

- Generated **sales listings automatically** based on structured user input
- Used **fine-tuned OpenAI models** to match the user’s personal writing tone
- Worked directly inside **Telegram** via a custom bot
- Supported multiple categories (real estate, cars, general products)
- Enforced **monthly usage limits**
- Provided a full marketing website for onboarding and pricing

## Project Status

This project is **no longer actively maintained**.

It was built early in my development career and reflects:
- Strong ambition
- Real experimentation with AI products
- Early design and architectural decisions

If I were to rebuild it today, I would:
- Simplify the architecture
- Improve UI/UX consistency
- Add automated tests
- Use a more scalable database
- Separate services more cleanly

That said, the project remains a solid demonstration of **end-to-end product development**, from idea to implementation.

## Why This Project Still Matters

- It was a **real business attempt**, not a tutorial
- It involved **real users**, real constraints, and real trade-offs
- It required integrating **AI, backend logic, and frontend UX**
- It shows my ability to **ship**, not just prototype

---

## Notes

- API keys and secrets are intentionally not included
- The UI copy is in Finnish, as the original target market was Finland
- The code reflects my skill level at the time (2025)
